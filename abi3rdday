Write a Python program to read the monthly salary of a person and his expenses under four categories: bank loan, hostel fees, food expenses, and parentsâ€™ support.
salary = int(input())
bank = int(input())
hostel = int(intput())
food = int(input())
parents = int(input())
spend = bank + hostel + food + parents
if(spend < salary):
    print("he can save the money")
elif(spend == salary):
    print("he can manage the money")
else:
    print("he want to work hard")
